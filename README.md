This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript and its solution. The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from a type mismatch between the function's expected argument and the actual argument passed. The solution focuses on ensuring the correct type is used or handling potential type mismatches.
